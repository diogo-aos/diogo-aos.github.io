  SOTA deep learning models have high performance, but it’s often not possible to apply them to very high resolution images due to memory or latency constraints. We propose a partitioning solution similar to REMIX, where partitions are defined using the uncertainty computed with a first level probabilistic detector. This first level model might be the same second level, with downsized input or a lightweight model. Each partition is then fed to a high or low accuracy model, depending on the objects of interest, or skipped completely.

# Introduction

Traditional models do not model uncertainty and their predictions can be wrong and over-confident.
Modelling uncertainty becomes ever more important for the use of learning-based algorithms in safety-critical applications, such as medical imaging and autonomous driving.
Predictive uncertainty estimation studies how to model such uncertainty.
Different approaches have

REMIX [87] detects pedestrians in high-resolution videos
within a latency budget given by the user. The input frame
is partitioned into several blocks, where more salient blocks
are processed using a computationally expensive but accurate
network whereas less salient blocks are processed using a
computationally cheap network or even skipped, as shown
in Figure 9. REMIX uses historical frames to determine the
object distribution, and determines the optimal partition using
a dynamic programming algorithm that takes into account
the given latency budget, the estimated object distribution, as
well as the accuracy and speed of available neural networks
for object detection
